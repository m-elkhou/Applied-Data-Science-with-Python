# Data Analysis with Python

For more information about the Badges please visit [LEARN TO ANALYZE DATA WITH PYTHON](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/data-analysis-python).

## Overview
In this course, you will learn how to analyze data in Python using multi-dimensional arrays in numpy, manipulate DataFrames in pandas, use SciPy library of mathematical routines, and perform machine learning using scikit-learn! You will learn how to perform data analytics in Python using these popular Python libraries and you will do it using hands-on labs using real Python tools like Jupyter notebook in JupyterLab.


## LEARN TO ANALYZE DATA WITH PYTHON
Learn how to analyze data using Python. This course will take you from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data. You will learn how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analyses, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more!

**You will learn how to:**

- Import data sets
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Manipulate pandas DataFrame
- Summarize data
- Build machine learning models using scikit-learn
- Build data pipelines

**Data Analysis with Python is delivered through lecture, hands-on labs, and assignments. It includes following parts:**

- Data Analysis libraries: will learn to use Pandas DataFrames, Numpy multi-dimentional arrays, and SciPy libraries to work with a various datasets. We will introduce you to pandas, an open-source library, and we will use it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. Then we will introduce you to another open-source library, scikit-learn, and we will use some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.
