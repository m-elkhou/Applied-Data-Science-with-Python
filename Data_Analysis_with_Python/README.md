## LEARN TO ANALYZE DATA WITH PYTHON
Learn how to analyze data using Python. This course will take you from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data. You will learn how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analyses, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more!

**You will learn how to:**

- Import data sets
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Manipulate pandas DataFrame
- Summarize data
- Build machine learning models using scikit-learn
- Build data pipelines
**Data Analysis with Python is delivered through lecture, hands-on labs, and assignments. It includes following parts:**

Data Analysis libraries: will learn to use Pandas DataFrames, Numpy multi-dimentional arrays, and SciPy libraries to work with a various datasets. We will introduce you to pandas, an open-source library, and we will use it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. Then we will introduce you to another open-source library, scikit-learn, and we will use some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.

# Overview

This is an open source, multi-threaded website crawler written in Python. There is still a lot of work to do, so feel free to help out with development.

***

Note: This is part of an open source search engine. The purpose of this tool is to gather links **only**. The analytics, data harvesting, and search algorithms are being created as separate programs. 


## Overview

This program is designed to iterate through a dataset and may choose to perform an action based on analysis of the data.
  
- **Condition** - expression to be evaluated 
- **Action** - function that will be invoked if the related _condition_ evaluates to true
- **Neuron** - pairing of an action to one or more conditions
- **Brain** - collection of all neurons
## Example Usage

Ella works by first analyzing the dataset provided by the user:
```json
[
  {"date": "1/1/17", "price": 25.48, "volume": 5500},
  {"date": "1/2/17", "price": 19.64, "volume": 1600},
  {"date": "1/3/17", "price": 25.57, "volume": 4800},
  {"date": "1/4/17", "price": 32.63, "volume": 2100},
  {"date": "1/5/17", "price": 29.85, "volume": 3700}
]
```

## Introduction

Ella is a self-improving decision organism.

## Overview

This program is designed to iterate through a dataset and may choose to perform an action based on analysis of the data.
  
- **Condition** - expression to be evaluated 
- **Action** - function that will be invoked if the related _condition_ evaluates to true
- **Neuron** - pairing of an action to one or more conditions
- **Brain** - collection of all neurons

## Diagram of Basic Neuron

## Example Usage

Ella works by first analyzing the dataset provided by the user:
```json
[
  {"date": "1/1/17", "price": 25.48, "volume": 5500},
  {"date": "1/2/17", "price": 19.64, "volume": 1600},
  {"date": "1/3/17", "price": 25.57, "volume": 4800},
  {"date": "1/4/17", "price": 32.63, "volume": 2100},
  {"date": "1/5/17", "price": 29.85, "volume": 3700}
]
```

She will then begin building the neurons by first generating random conditions based on the data.
```
volume > 3700
price < 19.64
```

Once conditions have been created, they are mapped to an action (creating the full neuron):
```
volume > 3700 - BUY
price < 19.64 - SELL
```

Ella will continue to create neurons until all actions have been mapped to a condition and the brain is complete. This
will ensure that the brain will have the ability to perform all possible functions.

Once full brain has been constructed, Ella will iterate over the dataset row by row and invoke all action events (fire
the neuron) if a condition is met. Therefore for each row analyzed, Ella may invoke multiple, a single, or no action 
events depending on how many conditions were met. 

Example using the above neurons and dataset:
```
Starting value:
$1000.00
 
Conditions:
volume > 3700 - BUY
price < 19.64 - SELL
 
---------- ANALYSIS ----------
 
Day 1 - {'price': 25.48, 'volume': 5500}
volume 5500 > 3700 -> BUY
 
Day 2 - {'price': 19.64, 'volume': 1600}
> NO ACTION
 
Day 3 - {'price': 25.57, 'volume': 4800}
volume 4800 > 3700 -> BUY
 
Day 4 - {'price': 32.63, 'volume': 2100}
> NO ACTION
 
Day 5 - {'price': 29.85, 'volume': 3700}
> NO ACTION
 
---------- RESULTS ----------
 
Final value:
$1008.65
```

## Developers

Feel free to contribute any by providing any bug fixes, suggestions, ideas, or anything else that may be of help.

Also, please note that this is just a small program I wrote this morning because I was bored waiting for the hockey game 
to start. It will most likely not be actively maintained, however I will check back frequently for pull requests and may
also add some new features in my spare time. 

- Python 3.6 (or newer) required
